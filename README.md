A tween system built around an intuitive inspector and being able to preview your tween directly in the editor exactly as it will be in the game, all without having to press play.

## Demo
If you would like to see all the sample scenes running in your browser, (click here)[https://developer.cloud.unity3d.com/share/-J0p_5e0IG/] to demo the project from unity cloud build.

## Installation
1. Download the latest release from the [Github Releases Page](https://github.com/miniscruff/preview-tween/releases).
   * Note: You will be able to download it from the unity asset store once it is published.
1. Import the unity package into your project.
   * If you are using a unity version before 5.6, you will have to remove the playmode tests as they wont compile properly by deleting the folder "PreviewTween / Tests / PlayMode".

### Running Automated Tests
Preview tween uses automated tests to confirm the features of the system are all running properly. If you would like to run the tests locally yourself or if you are making local changes you can use these tests to prevent regressions.
1. Open the Test Runner by going to "Window > Test Runner".
1. You can then run the Play Mode tests and the Edit Mode test by selecting Run All.

## Contributing
While preview tween is in early development the best way to contribute is by giving feedback through either github issues or by contacting me using the methods below. Additionally sharing the project, starring and forking the project is greatly appreciated.

If you or your team uses Preview Tween, even if its only for a small portion, of your app or game I would love to hear about it and may add it to this readme (with your permission of course).
